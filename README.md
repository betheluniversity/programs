# Program Sync

The Program Sync is used to pull program data from our Oracle database and add it into Cascade. The data pulled is specifically used for marketing purposes on www.bethel.edu. Pulling this data allows for fewer manual changes and keeps our programs on the website up to date. Currently we are only syncing CAPS/GS and Seminary data. We primarily only sync cohort data.
